##### Undergraduate Research

This is a research intensive course and students will do their research in small teams. The topic for the research project will be **"Solving the numerical problems in science with programming"**. Each group will find numerical problems in their science courses including mathematics and develop the C++ software to solve their problems. Each research group will submit the 4-6page design report and the code. They will also deliver 10-15 min presentation in the class room.

Therefore **CUNY RCR training is necessary for all students**. I will post a detail schedule at piazza.com later.
