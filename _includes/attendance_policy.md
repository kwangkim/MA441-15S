#### Attendance Policy

**Unexcused absences beyond 15% of course hours(2 weeks) result in a failing grade for the course.**  To excuse your absences, **a proper document with early notice** is necessary. Two late marks count as one absence. If students leave early with early notice, I will consider as one late mark.
