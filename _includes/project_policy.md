####Project Policy

* **There is no late projects will be accepted.** I strongly suggested you submit at least one day earlier than their due dates. 
* Academic Integrity is very important. **All projects must be the original work of the student (and group if applicable) to get a proper grade for projects.**
* Students will submit their **project code and design report** to [github.com](https://github.com/).
* For the final team project, students will submit their **project code, design report and presentation** to [github.com](https://github.com/).
