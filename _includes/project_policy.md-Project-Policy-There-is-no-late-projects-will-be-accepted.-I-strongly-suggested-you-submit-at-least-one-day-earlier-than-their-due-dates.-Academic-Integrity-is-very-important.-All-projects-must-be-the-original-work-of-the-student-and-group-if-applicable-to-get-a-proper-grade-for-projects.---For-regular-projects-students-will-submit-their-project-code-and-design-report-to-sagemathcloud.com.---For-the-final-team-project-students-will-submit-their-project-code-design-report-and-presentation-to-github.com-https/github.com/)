### Project Policy
**There is no late projects will be accepted.** I strongly suggested you submit at least one day earlier than their due dates. Academic Integrity is very important. **All projects must be the original work of the student (and group if applicable) to get a proper grade for projects.**
- For regular projects, students will submit their **project code and design report** to sagemathcloud.com.
- For the final team project, students will submit their **project code, design report and presentation** to [github.com](https://github.com/)
