2.2 derivative as a function

$$$
f'(x)=y=\frac{dy}{dx}=Df(x)=D_x f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$$
We can regard $$f'$$ as a new function, called the derivative of $$f$$.

#### Remark. $$D$$ $$\frac{d}{dx}$$ is called differentiation operators.

#### Example 1.

a. If $$f(x)=x^3-x$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.

#### Example 2.

a. If $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.

#### Example 3.

a. If $$f(x)=\frac{1-x}{2+x}$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.

#### Differentiable at $$a$$

> A function $$f$$ is differentiable at $$a$$ if $$f'(a)$$ exists. It is differentiable on an open interval $$(a,b)$$ if it is differentiable at every number in the interval.

#### Example 4.

Where us function $$f(x)=|x|$$  differentiable?

Hint: Consider three cases, $$x>0,~x=0,~x<0$$.

#### Theorem
If $$f$$ is differentiable at $$x=a $$, $$f$$ is continuous at $$x=a $$.

1. $$\lim_{x\to a} \left[ f(x)-f(a) \right]=0$$

2. Use $$f(x)=f(a)+f(x)-(a) $$ to prove $$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)=f(a) $$ 

#### (Converse ?)
The converse of above theorem is false since $$f(x)=|x| $$ is not differentiable at 0.

#### Fail to be differentiable!

1. A discontinuity by above theorem

2. A corner: No unique tangent line.

3. A vertical tangent line
