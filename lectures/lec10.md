2.2 derivative as a function

$$$
f'(x)=y=\frac{dy}{dx}=Df(x)=D_x f(x)=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$$
We cab regard $$f'$$ as a new function, called the derivative of $$f$$.

#### Example 1.

a. If $$f(x)=x^3-x$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.

#### Example 2.

a. If $$f(x)=\sqrt{x}$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.

#### Example 3.

a. If $$f(x)=\frac{1-x}{2+x}$$, find a formula for $$f'(x)$$.

b. Illustrate by comparing the graphs of $$f$$ and $$f'$$.

c. Find the domain of $$f'$$.
