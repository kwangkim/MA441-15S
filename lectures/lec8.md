## LEC 8

### The Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT) 
Suppose that $f$ is continus on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and let $N$ be any number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$. where $f(a)\neq f(b)$ .
Then there exists a number $c$ in $(a,b)$ such that $f(c)=N$.

#### Remark

1. $c$ does not need to be unique.
2. close interval in realline is very important. It has very good properties like compact and connected(path-connected) and continuous function $f$ preserves it.
So $f([a,b])$ is compact and connected in realine and it is also close interval. If we assume $f(a)<f(b)$, $N\in [f(a),f(b)]\subset f([a,b])$.
3. IVT is very useful to prove the existence of a root of certain equations.

#### Example 1. Show that there is a root of the equation
$$
4x^3-6x^2+3x-2=0
$$
between $1$ and $2$.

1. Let $f(x)=4x^3-6x^2+3x-2$ then $f$ is continuous on $\doubleR$
